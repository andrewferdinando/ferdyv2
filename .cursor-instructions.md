# Cursor Project Instructions – Ferdy

This project uses documentation as the source of truth.

Before making any code changes:

- Read the relevant files in `docs/processes/`

- Follow the documented behaviour exactly

If behaviour is unclear or conflicts with the docs:

- Do NOT guess

- Ask for clarification before implementing

Code should align with existing architecture and patterns.
