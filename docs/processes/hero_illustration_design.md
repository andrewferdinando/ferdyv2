# Hero Illustration Design Process

## Overview

This document describes the design process and specifications for Ferdy's hero illustrations used on the marketing website. These illustrations communicate Ferdy's core value proposition: transforming raw content inputs into polished, scheduled social media posts through AI automation.

## Design Philosophy

Ferdy's hero illustrations follow a **Trello-style transformation approach**, emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and professionalism. The illustrations are not UI screenshots but rather conceptual representations of the product's workflow and value.

## Visual Structure

All hero illustrations follow a consistent three-part horizontal structure:

### Left Side: Inputs
Represents the raw materials Ferdy uses to create social posts:
- **Website info**: Browser card showing website content
- **Content library**: Media gallery with approved images/videos
- **Old social post references**: Previous posts for style/tone reference
- **Category cards**: Service categories, events, offers, tips, etc.

### Middle: Ferdy AI Engine
Represents the AI processing layer (kept simple and clean):
- **Ferdy logo or icon**: Central brand element
- **Simple processing indicator**: Minimal visual representation of AI work
- **Flow arrows**: Connecting inputs to outputs
- **No complex machinery**: Avoid over-complicated gears, circuits, or busy elements

### Right Side: Outputs
Represents the finished, scheduled social posts:
- **Instagram post mockup**: Realistic post card with image and caption
- **Facebook post mockup**: Realistic post card with image and caption
- **Calendar/schedule indicators**: Shows posts are scheduled across time
- **Ongoing automation cues**: Visual elements suggesting continuous operation

## Design Specifications

### Format
- **Orientation**: Horizontal landscape
- **Placement**: Below hero headline on homepage
- **Size**: Large-format, suitable for full-width sections
- **Aspect Ratio**: Approximately 16:9 or wider

### Style Guidelines
- **Card aesthetic**: Floating cards with soft shadows (Trello-style)
- **Color palette**: Ferdy blue (`#3b82f6`) to violet (`#8b5cf6`) gradient
- **Background**: White or subtle light blue gradient
- **Typography**: Minimal text, labels only (no paragraphs)
- **Shadows**: Soft, diffuse shadows for depth
- **Borders**: Subtle borders on cards (`slate-100`)

### Tone & Aesthetic
- **Professional**: Calm, trustworthy, business-appropriate
- **Clean**: Uncluttered, generous white space
- **Modern**: Contemporary SaaS design language
- **Simple**: Easy to understand at a glance
- **Not playful**: Avoid cartoonish or overly casual elements

## Key Messaging

Each illustration should communicate:

1. **Transformation**: Clear visual journey from raw inputs to polished outputs
2. **Automation**: Ongoing, continuous operation (not one-off posting)
3. **AI Intelligence**: Smart processing in the middle layer
4. **Time-saving**: Efficiency through automation
5. **Multi-platform**: Posts for both Instagram and Facebook
6. **Scheduling**: Posts distributed across time

## Design Iterations

### Version 1 (December 2024)
Initial concepts explored three metaphors:
- Smart Transformation Flow (AI brain)
- Content Assembly Line (funnel/processor)
- Automated Scheduling Workflow (circular automation)

**Feedback**: Too complex in the middle section, needed simpler Ferdy representation

### Version 2 (December 2024)
Refined concepts based on feedback:
- Simplified middle section to just Ferdy logo with minimal processing indicators
- Clearer input cards: website, content library, old posts
- More realistic social post mockups on the right
- Reduced visual complexity overall
